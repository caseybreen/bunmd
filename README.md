numident paper 

**Abstract:** The Numerical Identification System (Numident) forms the backbone of the U.S. Social Security Administrationâ€™s record keeping system. For every person with a Social Security number, the Numident tracks claims status, date of birth (and, if applicable, death), as well as other background information including birthplace, race, sex, and names of parents. In 2013, the Social Security Administration transferred a large portion of their Numident records to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The public release of these records in 2019, which we call "NARA Numident," offers nearly complete coverage of those who died from 1988 to 2005. In this paper, we describe the contents of the publicly available records, introduce a cleaned and harmonized version of the data, and show how the records can be used for the study of mortality in the United States.
