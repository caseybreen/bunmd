Replication Package

The this repository includes code to replicate all figures and tables in the paper. There are three steps to running the replication code:

1. Clone this repository
2. Download the BUNMD file from the CenSoc Project Download Page, unzip the data file, and move it to the top level of the 'data' subfolder.
3. Run the 00_run_all.Rmd script, which will run all code (or run scripts 01 and 02 individually)


Data

Please download the BUNMD from the CenSoc Project Download Page. After downloading the BUNMD, move it into the data folder of the replication repository. 

Code

Researchers can run the following script to replicate all figures:

* 00_run_all.Rmd - this file runs all scripts.

Alternatively, researchers can run the following files individually in order:

* 01_descriptive_figures.Rmd - this file contains code to replicate the following figures in the paper:

— Figure 1
— Figure 2
— Figure 3
— Figure A-2
— Figure A-3

* 02_case_studies.Rmd - this file runs code to replicate the two case studies and the following figures in the paper:

— Figure 4
— Figure 5
