title: "Generate BUNMD Weights"

Background: this notebook to generates post-stratification person-weights for the BUNMD for custom sub-samples. See Sections 2.1 amd 2.2 of paper for more details on weighting strategy and considerations. 

By default, this function constructs weights for those dying between 1988 and 2005, born between 1895 and 1940, dying between ages of 65 and 100, with non-missing values for `race_last` and `bpl`. However, the arguments of the `create_weights_bunmd_complete` function can be changed. For instance, if a user wasn't using race in their analysis, they could adapt the code to not require `race_last` to be non-missing. 

To run this script, will need to download a copy of the `USA.Deaths_lexis.txt` file from the Human Mortality Database (https://www.mortality.org/Country/Country?cntr=USA). 

```{r}
## library packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(here)


## read in bunmd
bunmd <- fread(here("data/bunmd_v2.csv"))

## deaths from HMD 
## update this path
hmd_deaths <-  fread("/path/to/USA.Deaths_lexis.txt") %>%
    mutate(linking_key = paste(Year, Cohort, Age, sep = "_" ))

#' Create weights for BUNMD
#' This function will weight the numident file up to HMD lexis triangles
#' Restrict data to deaths from 1988 - 2005 with age_at_death between 65 and 100.
create_weights_bunmd_complete <- function(bunmd.file, dyears = c(1988:2005), cohorts = c(1895:1940), death_ages = c(65:100), complete_cases_vars = c("race_last", "bpl"), hmd_deaths = hmd_deaths) {

  ## filter to complete case
  high_coverage_complete_sample <- bunmd %>%
    filter(dyear %in% dyears) %>%
    filter(byear %in% cohorts) %>%
    filter(death_age %in% death_ages) %>%
    filter(!is.na(sex)) %>%
    drop_na(complete_cases_vars)

  ## tabulate complete cases
  numdeath_aggregate_counts <- high_coverage_complete_sample %>%
    group_by(death_age, dyear, byear, sex) %>%
    tally() %>%
    mutate(linking_key = paste(dyear, byear, death_age, sep = "_")) %>%
    ungroup(dyear, death_age)

  ## create inverse probability weights
  death_weights <- numdeath_aggregate_counts %>%
    inner_join(hmd_deaths, by = "linking_key") %>%
    mutate(proportion_matched = case_when(
      sex == 1 ~ n/Male,
      sex == 2 ~ n/Female)) %>%
    group_by(dyear, byear, sex, death_age) %>%
    summarize(inclusion_prob = mean(proportion_matched), Male = mean(Male), Female = mean(Female), Total = mean(Total))

  ## create death weights
  death_weights_for_link <-  death_weights %>%
    mutate(linking_key = paste(dyear, byear, death_age, sex, sep = "_")) %>%
    ungroup(dyear, death_age, sex) %>%
    select(inclusion_prob, linking_key) %>%
    mutate(weight_alt = 1/inclusion_prob) %>%
    select(-inclusion_prob)

  ## create linking key
  high_coverage_complete_sample <- high_coverage_complete_sample %>%
    mutate(linking_key = paste(dyear, byear, death_age, sex, sep = "_")) %>%
    select(-byear)

  ## link death weights to ssn
  weights.df <- high_coverage_complete_sample %>%
    left_join(death_weights_for_link, by = "linking_key") %>%
    select(ssn, weight_alt)

  ## add weights back to original sample
  bunmd.file <- bunmd.file %>%
    left_join(weights.df, by = "ssn")

  return(bunmd.file)
}

## example construct weights require bpl variable to be non-missing 
## new weight variable = weight_alt
bunmd_weights <-  create_weights_bunmd_complete(bunmd.file = bunmd, dyears = c(1988:2005), cohorts = c(1895:1940), death_ages = c(65:100), complete_cases_vars = c("bpl"), hmd_deaths = hmd_deaths)
