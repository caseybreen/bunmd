## Summary 

This script runs all code to replicate figures and tables for the paper "Berkeley Unified Numident Mortality Database: Public Administrative Records for Individual-Level Mortality Research" 

To replicate the figures and tables in this paper, you must: 

(1) Clone this repository 

(2) Download a copy of the BUNMD V2 from the CenSoc download page: https://censoc-download.demog.berkeley.edu/. 

(3) Unzip the BUNMD V2 file and move it to the "data" folder in the top level of the bunmd directory. 

(4) Run the "run all" script. All figures and table will be automatically generated. 

The scripts are numbered in the order they should be run.

Code to install Gompertztrunc package: 

## Install gompertztrunc 

```{r}
## install gompertztrunc package from Github by uncommenting the lines below

## library(devtools)
## devtools::install_github("https://github.com/caseybreen/gompertztrunc")
```

## Run code to replicate 

```{r}
## library packages 
library(here)
source(here("code", "helper_functions.R"))

## list of rmd files 
rmd_files <- list.files(path = file.path(here("code//")), pattern=".Rmd")   
rmd_files <- rmd_files[!rmd_files %in% "00_run_all.Rmd"]

## set seed for reproducibility 
set.seed(1)


for (cur_file in rmd_files[1:3]) {
	cat("================================\n")
	tictoc::tic(glue::glue("Finished with {cur_file}, time:"))
	cat("Running ", cur_file, "\n")
  	source_rmd(cur_file) ## source_rmd is a custom function defined in "helper_functions.R" 
  	tictoc::toc()
	cat("================================\n")
}
```
